<h1>The MIRIAD MacPort Homepage</h1>

<p>This is the homepage of the <a
href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> package of the <a
href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Miriad">MIRIAD</a>
radio astronomy suite, which makes it easy to install and update
MIRIAD on your Mac OS&nbsp;X computer.</p>

<p><b>This is not the homepage of MIRIAD itself</b> and we're not
going to discuss what MIRIAD is or why you might want to install
it. If you have questions along those lines, see:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Miriad">the MIRIAD wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/miriad/">the CARMA MIRIAD site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mmarray.org/bugzilla/">the CARMA bugzilla</a>
(which tracks MIRIAD bugs amongst others)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/">the
homepage for the ATNF version of MIRIAD</a> (which differs somewhat
from the software we're discussing)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're like most people, you'll probably dive right in to the <a
href="#installing">installation instructions</a>, but you might find
it helpful to read the <a href="#background">background information</a> as well.</p>

<div id="latest">The version of MIRIAD distributed through MacPorts was
last updated on <b>2010 July 6</b>. See <a
href="#releases">below</a> for information on what&apos;s changed since
the last snapshot.</div>

<h2><a name="background">Background: MacPorts?</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> is a system to ease
the installation and management of Unix-oriented software on Apple
computers.  Since <a
href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/wiki/index.php/Miriad">MIRIAD</a> is
hard to build as it is and OS&nbsp;X is somewhat different than most
Unix-like operating systems, we think that installing MIRIAD through
MacPorts will be an appealing choice for the many astronomers with
Apple hardware.</p>

<p>MacPorts works by providing some general tools for managing
software installations as well as a database of recipes for compiling
many, many pieces of software. The “MacPorts package of
MIRIAD” is one of these recipes. It links to a recent snapshot
of the MIRIAD source code, the other pieces of software which need to
be present in order to compile MIRIAD, and so on. We update the
snapshot and the recipe periodically so that MacPorts users can easily
track recent MIRIAD development.</p>

<p>The key advantage to using MacPorts to compile something like
MIRIAD is that it provides a relatively controlled environment for
building the software. Most build problems are due to little
differences between the software installed on one person's computer
and another's, so eliminating those differences goes a long way to
eliminating build problems.</p>

<p>A secondary goal of the MacPorts distribution of MIRIAD is to provide
frequently-updated, versioned packages of the MIRIAD source code. It's
easier to track down bugs and reproduce results when the code you're
using comes in discrete, uniquely-named releases. The MacPorts
packages of MIRIAD have unique version numbers (via the inclusion of
their release date in the version number) so that it's easy to specify
exactly which code you're using. The source code bundles distributed
on this page will compile on all systems, so you don't have to be an
OS&nbsp;X user to take advantage of this.</p>

<h2><a name="installing">Installing MIRIAD with MacPorts</a></h2>

<p>Installation can take a long time but is as straightforward as we
can make it. The steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you will be able to leave your computer running for
several hours. The initial install does not need much attention but
will take a while to compile everything. (Updates are faster.)</li>

<li>Install the MacPorts system on your computer using <a
href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">these instructions</a>. If
you need help with this step, there's a lot of information available
online; see <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php#help">the
MacPorts help links</a> at the bottom of their installation page or <a
href="http://trac.macports.org/#MacPortsSupport">the generic MacPorts
support page</a>.</li>

<li>Open a terminal and run
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port sync</tt>
</blockquote>
to fetch the most up-to-date data from the MacPorts server.</li>

<li>Which telescope will you be reducing data from?
<ul>
<li>If you're using <a href="http://www.mmarray.org/">CARMA</a>, note
down that your “variant string” is <tt>+carma</tt>.</li>
<li>If you're using the <a href="http://ral.berkeley.edu/ata/">Allen Telescope
Array</a>, note down that your “variant string” is <tt>+ata</tt>.</li>
<li>For anything else: <a href="#contact">contact the port maintainer</a>
and ask for a “variant” to be created for your telescope. In
the meantime, you can probably use an <em>empty</em> “variant string”
and get started OK.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Install the software on which MIRIAD depends. Execute the
following magic command in your terminal, replacing “VARIANTS” with
the “variant string” you determined above, and putting the whole
command on one line:
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port -u install `port info --depends miriad VARIANTS
      |perl -ne 'print "$1 " while /port:([^,])+)/g'`</tt>
</blockquote>
For example, for an ATA user,
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port -u install `port info --depends miriad +ata
      |perl -ne 'print "$1 " while /port:([^,])+)/g'`</tt>
</blockquote>
Your computer will begin to work for a long time. (If the command
fails instantly, triple–check that you entered it in correctly.) You
might take this opportunity to read <a
href="http://guide.macports.org/">the MacPorts Guide</a> for some
overall documentation of the MacPorts system, how it works, and how to
keep it running smoothly on your machine.
</li>

<li>Eventually, your computer should finish without printing any
obvious error messages.  If something seems to have failed, the
problem is outside of the MIRIAD MacPort and we can't offer you any
specific advice. Consult your local system administrator or ask <a
href="#contact">the port maintainer</a> nicely.</li>

<li>Install MIRIAD itself. In your terminal, run
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port -vku install miriad VARIANTS</tt>
</blockquote>
replacing “VARIANTS” as before.</li>

<li>It will take something like half an hour to compile MIRIAD. Once
again, consider reading <a href="http://guide.macports.org/">the
MacPorts Guide</a> while this is happening. Your computer should
finish with a message about “Activating miriad”, some notes on setting
up your shell, and no obvious error messages.  If something seems to
have failed, <a href="#contact">contact the port maintainer</a> with
the <em>exact</em> text of the output that's worrying you.</li>
</ol>

<p>For general help with the MacPorts system, see <a
href="http://trac.macports.org/#MacPortsSupport">the MacPorts support
page</a>, which we hope you will find useful. That page, however, has
no MIRIAD-specific information.</p>

<h2><a name="updating">Updating MIRIAD with MacPorts</a></h2>

<p>Once you have MIRIAD installed in this way, you can update your
installation with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal.</li>
<li>Run
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port sync</tt>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Run
<blockquote>
  <tt>sudo port -vunk upgrade miriad</tt>
</blockquote>If nothing happens, you already have the most recent
version of MIRIAD that's been uploaded to MacPorts.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you get an error, you might try opening a terminal and running:</p>

<ol>
<li><tt>sudo port selfupdate</tt></li>
<li><tt>sudo port -u upgrade outdated</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>It is also good to run these commands once in a while even if you
don't get any errors with MIRIAD. They may, however, take a long time
to run. More information on keeping your MacPorts installation running
smoothly are beyond the scope of these instructions. Once again,
consult <a href="http://trac.macports.org/#MacPortsSupport">the
MacPorts support page</a>.</p>

<p>The MacPort version of MIRIAD is updated approximately every few
months. Updates will be released more rapidly for key bugfixes to the
tasks or build system &mdash; <a href="#contact">contact the port
maintainer</a> to request an update. The source code bundles are
produced by a <tt>make&nbsp;dist</tt> using the autotools in a
pristine checkout of the MIRIAD source code. The “last updated
version” mentioned at the top of this webpage may be either
ahead of or behind what your MacPorts system says is available,
depending on the timing of updates to their site and this one.</p>

<h2><a name="releases">Release History</a></h2>

<p>Releases of MIRIAD itself are infrequent, so we name our releases
with the date they were produced as well as the MIRIAD version
number. Note that <b>you don&apos;t need to download the source code
here</b> to install MIRIAD with MacPorts &mdash; the MacPorts system
takes care of that step for you.</p>

<h2><a name="compilers">Advanced Topic: Choosing Compilers</a></h2>

<p>The MIRIAD MacPort allows you flexibility in choosing the compiler
used to compile MIRIAD. <em>Unless you know of a specific reason to
avoid the default compiler, you should use it.</em> If you want to
use a specific version of the MacPorts–distributed copies of <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, there are <tt>+gccXY</tt> variants
in the MacPort that will build MIRIAD using GCC version
<tt>X.Y</tt>. Use the command <tt>port info miriad</tt> to get a listing
of which of these variants are supported.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use a compiler other than the MacPorts-provided
version of GCC to compile MIRIAD. <em>This setup is neither
recommended nor supported because of the subtle bugs that very often
result from nonstandard compiler configurations.</em> If you are not
able to install MIRIAD on a Mac successfully without the use of the
MacPort, you should probably not attempt to use a nonstandard compiler
configuration. However, the use of a custom compiler can provide
certain advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster code if the compiler has a better optimizer than GCC.</li>
<li>A quicker first-time build of MIRIAD because the MacPort version
of GCC doesn't need to be built. Note that this is a one-time-only
gain since once the GCC is built it can be reused with
recompilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose which compiler will be used to build MIRIAD by
installing the <tt>gcc_select</tt> MacPort, specifying a compiler with
the <tt>gcc_select</tt> command, and building the MIRIAD MacPort while
specifying the <tt>+gcc_select</tt> variant.</p>
<p>To build MIRIAD with a custom compiler, then, you need to define
your compiler's setup in the <tt>gcc_select</tt> system and then select
it. This is done by creating a file in <tt>/opt/local/etc/select/gcc</tt>
named something like <tt>custom</tt> of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>/path/to/cc
/path/to/cpp
/path/to/c++
/path/to/c++
-
-
/path/to/fc</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Each line in the file specifies the path to a standard compiler
executable. Most notably, the last line specifies the Fortran compiler
to use. (The two lines with dashes point to the Java compiler and the
code coverage tool, typically gcj and gcov. These are not used when
compiling MIRIAD.) <em>If you mix and match executables from different
compiler versions, your build will almost assuredly fail.</em> Then,
“select” your new compiler by running a command such as
</p>
<blockquote>
  <tt>gcc_select custom</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>This support should be sufficient for you to attempt building the
MIRIAD MacPort with any compiler you want, but be prepared for a lot
of frustration and wasted time unless you know exactly what you're
doing.</p>
