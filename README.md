The MIRIAD MacPort
====================

These are support files for the Portfile that allows
[CARMA MIRIAD](http://github.com/pkgw/carma-miriad) to
be built in the [MacPorts](http://macports.org/) system. This
repository is probably of less interest than
[the MIRIAD MacPort homepage](http://astro.berkeley.edu/~pkwill/miriad-macport/),
which explains how the MacPort works and how to install it.
