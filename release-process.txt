Instructions for pushing out a new MIRIAD MacPort release.

- Create tarball from an unmodified checkout of the CVSHEAD branch of
  the git mirror

- Fetch MacPorts' version of the Portfile from *link found at bottom of*
  http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/science/miriad/Portfile,
  and commit any changes they've made.

- Update portfile with version, SHA1 and a temporary datecode in
  the next-update branch. Commit.

- Test out on sleepy, etc. Iterate with temporary datecodes until
  works.

- Update portfile with final version, datecode, SHA1, RMD160.
  ('openssl rmd160 {filename}' to generate that hash.)

- Create diff and file ticket for port update at
  https://trac.macports.org/newticket ; see previous tickets at
  http://tinyurl.com/42voccl . Add "haspatch" and "maintainer" keywords.

- Update metadata and docs:

  - versions.txt
  - "last updated" text in web/index.html
  - Release History

- ./pushweb.sh, proofread.

- Commit changes to miriad-macport to master branch.

- Wait.
