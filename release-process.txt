Creating a new MIRIAD MacPort release:

- Get MIRIAD CVS HEAD to desired release state.

- Update git mirror, push to GitHub.

- Create tarball from an **unmodified checkout** of the **CVSHEAD branch** of
  the git mirror.

- Sync with MacPorts' version of the Portfile:
    curl -L http://tinyurl.com/8z3kb27 >ports/science/miriad/Portfile
  Commit any changes.

- Update portfile with version, datecode, RMD160, SHA256. Update versions.txt
  with tarball and git commit SHA1s.  ('openssl rmd160 {filename}')

- Test if desired. Commit when happy.

- Copy release tarball to web directory. Verify SHA1. Update
  miriad-latest.tar.gz symlink.

- Create diff and file ticket for port update at
  https://trac.macports.org/newticket ; see previous tickets at
  http://tinyurl.com/42voccl . Add "haspatch" and "maintainer" keywords.

- Wait for MacPorts to commit and propagate update

- Resync with MacPorts version in case they monkeyed with anything.
